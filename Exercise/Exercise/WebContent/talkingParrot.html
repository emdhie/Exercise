			<h2>Talking Parrot</h2>
			<div class="intro">
				<div class="pad">
					<div class="prob">
						Problem: You recently bought a parrot who loves to talk - a lot.
						You decide to write a small program where you can enter what he
						talks and the program tells you the number of words spoken. When
						this exercise is run, it will ask you to enter a line of text. All
						the words from that line will be stored in an array of Strings
						called 'words'.<br> You have to print the length of the array
							to the system console.
					</div>
					<div class="prob">
						What we expect:<br> If you entered the following line of text
							when the program was run:<br> "Hi there how are you"<br>
									We expect you to print the number '5' to the system console.
